Let us introduce you to another speaker: [Xavier Noria](https://twitter.com/#!/fxn).

You probably know Xavier for being a Rails core team member since 2005, but did you know
he won a Ruby Hero award in 2010, led the Barcelona.pm user group and rides a wonderful Goldwind?

He's actually planning on riding from Barcelona to Lyon. How cool is that? :)

Xavier will present **Constants in Ruby**. He will go thru their usage and go deeper
explaining the technical basis of constant autoloading in Rails.

So don't miss out the remaining early bird tickets!
