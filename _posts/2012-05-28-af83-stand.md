## af83, Ruby Sponsor, opens its Booth to U:<br /><br /><small>Local Ruby Group Strength is with U</small>

As a Ruby Sponsor, af83 has the opportunity to handle a booth during the
2-day conf in the main hall. However, they only want U, Ruby
Hacktivists, to handle it. Ruby is all about its community and af83 is
committed to continue supporting it. So if you want to use the booth to
promote your Open Source projects, hack with friends, or hire new
members for your local group or association, you'll be totally FREE to
do so and will be af83 guest to the conf.

Interested? Just shout @af83 #ruluopenbooth or reach out at
community at af83 dot com.
