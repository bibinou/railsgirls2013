Hey Folks!

We are very happy to invite you to the Rulu After Party & Dinner on Friday 22nd
at 18h00.

The party will be held 15 minutes away walking from the
conference venue in a Gourmet Restaurant & Pub called "[Le
Koodeta](http://goo.gl/maps/5Qdi)"
featuring a large patio with olive trees and an outdoor bar.

A good party requires good music, so we've just created the
[collaborative playlist Rulu 2012](http://open.spotify.com/user/pcreux/playlist/6AxDMjyQCCU6WIwfzdA3b0) on Spotify. Go add music you'd like people to
listen to during Rulu breaks, lunch, dinner & party! :)

See you in about a week!
