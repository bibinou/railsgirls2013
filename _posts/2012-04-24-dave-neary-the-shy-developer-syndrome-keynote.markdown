In less than two months will take place RuLu 2012. We've received so much
love last year we decided to reiterate this year.

Our first invited speaker is [Dave Neary](https://twitter.com/#!/nearyd). Dave describes
himself as a "Free Software/Open Source community guy" and you probably met him:

* he was on the board of directors of the GNOME Foundation
* he (co-)organized the GUADEC in 2005-2007 and the first [Libre Graphics Meeting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre_Graphics_Meeting) (which took place in Lyon)

His keynote will be called "The Shy Developer Syndrome". I won't give too much details before we disclose the complete schedule.

Please note that the CFP will end on the 27th of April. At this time, the selection process has not taken place yet.
